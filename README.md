# hello-world

Hi guys!

My name is Zongran, alias Bill. People do find my Chinese(real) name hard to pronounce, so I have been using my English name ever since.

I have briefly read through the syntax of a few major languages like C++(my first language), Java, Javascript, C, Ruby, python, HTML, CSS and PHP. They are really hard to learn somehow.

Hope to find out more about the programming community!
